#+TITLE: Novogene Download Pipeline

This is an ansible playbook cobbled from an old makescript I use to download sequence data from Novogene.

This would all be easy if they had a decent FTP, but they don't, so we use this:

1. Run Puppeteer to navigate the site, select the batch, and download the JSON manifest
2. Download archive(s), do checksums
3. Unpack archive(s), do checksums
4. Upload data to the UseGalaxy FTP and then into an annotated Galaxy history.
5. Store the sample in local archives
6. Log to (org-mode) spreadsheet.


Email's are sent to an address of choice, but relies on a gmi/lieer,
and notmuch installation which is done elsewhere: that is, this repo
is a submodule of a larger email server hosted at:
